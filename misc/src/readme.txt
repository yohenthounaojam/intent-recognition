> cnn2d_and_lstm_artificial_neurons.py: Contains the code to train from LSTM for
    action recognition over frames' visual features extracted from pretrained 2D
    CNN. The training is done clip wise.

> create_seq_frame_feacture_vecs.py: Contains the code to create frames' visual
    features of videos in HDD dataset clip wise. Pretrained 2D CNNs are employed
    to extract visual features.

> create_frame_features_all_videos.py: Contains the code to create visual
    features of all frames in each video. Pretrained 2D CNNs are used to extract
    visual features.
